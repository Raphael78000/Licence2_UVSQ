(   750 )    limned form--but then I thought of the legends.

(   784 )    Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours

(   785 )    alone--I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;

(   790 )    this storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, antique masonry

(   793 )    atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and

(   796 )    watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of

(   805 )    I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; so

(   806 )    rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the

(   807 )    light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most

(   816 )    within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this _variety_ which

(   823 )    All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his

(   825 )    and then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about them

(   826 )    which filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle's

(   830 )    phrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he

(   838 )    relate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with a

(   866 )    I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were

(   875 )    in time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle

(   879 )    Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the

(   880 )    most disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal

(   882 )    lay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing

(   885 )    recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a

(   886 )    pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek

(   894 )    I had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that in

(   895 )    this sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the

(   902 )    at things more potent than luminosity. This I perceived with unhealthy

(   907 )    almost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp the

(   909 )    before the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for the

(   910 )    scream had been in my uncle's voice, and I knew not against what menace

(   911 )    I should have to defend him and myself.

(   913 )    Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors

(   918 )    vague outlines half human and half monstrous, through which I could see

(   922 )    chimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is only in conscious

(   923 )    retrospection that I ever definitely traced its damnable approach to

(   932 )    It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled

(   936 )    loomed on my left, I threw on the current of the Crookes tube apparatus,

(   940 )    yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes. But I saw the dimness

(   944 )    Then, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror

(   947 )    terrors I loosed upon the world, or what thoughts or judgments of men I

(   948 )    brought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form

(   958 )    I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult and

(   961 )    counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen in

(   962 )    the School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught the

(   963 )    raw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting in

(   969 )    face. I like to think that he existed at that moment, and that he tried

(   970 )    to bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccupped a farewell from my own

(   971 )    parched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of grease

(   977 )    street, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked

(   984 )    end I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light, and entered

(   985 )    that awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar, and which still

(   987 )    dared not speak.

(   991 )    I looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, and

(   992 )    the yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could

(   994 )    trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than

(   995 )    I had dreamed.

(   997 )    Sitting down, I tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me

(   998 )    just what had happened, and how I might end the horror, if indeed it had

(  1002 )    certain churchyards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at the

(  1006 )    In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for

(  1007 )    home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,

(  1010 )    Benefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed the

(  1014 )    At eleven a. m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather,

(  1015 )    and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the

(  1016 )    unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling

(  1017 )    anybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because

(  1019 )    toward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front of the

(  1021 )    white fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of what

(  1022 )    I might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind,

(  1025 )    My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in

(  1026 )    the large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was

(  1027 )    about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of

(  1029 )    the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look

(  1031 )    waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the

(  1033 )    of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty

(  1034 )    them all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I dumped

(  1036 )    gas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a

(  1039 )    Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and

(  1041 )    my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the

(  1042 )    light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was

(  1044 )    of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was

(  1048 )    Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and

(  1052 )    _elbow_ I had seen.

(  1060 )    the Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to the source.

(  1062 )    some disordered water-pipe or gas main underground--but again I could

(  1063 )    correct them if I dared. It was unspeakably shocking, and I do not see

(  1064 )    how I lived through it. I did faint after emptying the fourth carboy,

(  1065 )    which I had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask;

(  1066 )    but when I recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapors.

(  1068 )    The two remaining carboys I emptied down without particular result, and

(  1069 )    after a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It

(  1070 )    was twilight before I was done, but fear had gone out of the place. The

(  1075 )    as I patted down the last spadeful of mold, I shed the first of the many

(  1076 )    tears with which I have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle's

(  1082 )    me, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn

(    40 )     _A posthumous story of immense power, written by a master of weird

(    41 )       fiction--a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old

(    45 )        Howard Phillips Lovecraft died last March, at the height of his

(    46 )        career. Though only forty-six years of age, he had built up an

(    48 )        craftsmanship of his weird tales; and he was regarded on both sides

(    49 )        of the Atlantic as probably the greatest contemporary master of

(    50 )        weird fiction. His ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding

(    55 )    From even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent. Sometimes it

(    56 )    enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it

(    59 )    Providence, where in the late forties Edgar Allan Poe used to sojourn

(    60 )    often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess, Mrs.

(    65 )    churchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of Eighteenth Century

(    69 )    greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a

(    70 )    particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated

(    73 )    not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is there any evidence

(    75 )    possession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror the

(    76 )    wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly, and

(    77 )    stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous.

(    79 )    The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract the

(    80 )    attention of the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm building, it

(    81 )    followed the average New England colonial lines of the middle Eighteenth

(    84 )    dictated by the progress of taste at that time. It faced south, with one

(    88 )    and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for Benefit

(    90 )    amongst the graveyards of the first settlers, and straightened only when

(    91 )    the removal of the bodies to the North Burial Ground made it decently

(    95 )    precipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at about

(    96 )    the time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space,

(    99 )    ground, close to the new line of public travel. When the sidewalk was

(   100 )    laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed;

(   101 )    and Poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull gray

(   102 )    brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet by

(   103 )    the antique shingled bulk of the house proper.

(   109 )    Wheaton Street. The space south of the house, abutting on Benefit

(   110 )    Street, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forming

(   111 )    a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a

(   112 )    steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon-like

(   113 )    surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick walks, and

(   115 )    from tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia set off the

(   124 )    place. It was plainly unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness and

(   126 )    the hallways, or the quality of the well and pump water. These things

(   128 )    whom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle, Doctor Elihu

(   130 )    formed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time servants and humble

(   136 )    of the community as in any real sense "haunted." There were no

(   137 )    widespread tales of rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguished

(   140 )    dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more

(   143 )    impossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off suddenly

(   147 )    in varying degree a type of anemia or consumption, and sometimes a

(   148 )    decline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the salubriousness

(   149 )    of the building. Neighboring houses, it must be added, seemed entirely

(   158 )    at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the

(   159 )    eldritch atmosphere and odor of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked

(   160 )    front door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-paned

(   161 )    windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round

(   163 )    falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered

(   165 )    the fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend

(   168 )    of chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit

(   171 )    But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house. It

(   176 )    fascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity. For

(   177 )    one thing, the bad odor of the house was strongest there; and for

(   181 )    were truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of toadstools

(   184 )    that nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behind

(   185 )    the broken panes of the fetor-spreading windows.

(   188 )    by night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect the

(   192 )    cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor--a vague, shifting deposit of

(   193 )    mold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the

(   194 )    sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen.

(   200 )    strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin,

(   205 )    the wild ancient tales of the common folk--a notion likewise alluding to

(   207 )    queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrust

(   215 )    a sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for all his

(   218 )    of markedly unsanitary qualities, had nothing to do with abnormality;

(   220 )    interest would in a boy's fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome

(   224 )    gentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lance

(   225 )    with such controversial guardians of tradition as Sidney S. Rider and

(   228 )    steep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and

(   229 )    colony house where his grandfather--a cousin of that celebrated

(   232 )    independence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp,

(   235 )    records of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions

(   243 )    of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding,

(   247 )    hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared

(   257 )    loved--the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where tombs and

(   258 )    headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the

(   259 )    houses and bank walls of Benefit Street.

(   261 )    The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no

(   262 )    trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the

(   264 )    of calamity, soon increased to boding significance, was apparent. My

(   265 )    uncle's carefully compiled record began with the building of the

(   267 )    detail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by William

(   271 )    trade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After

(   272 )    Brown's death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Company made him

(   273 )    master of the brig _Prudence_, Providence-built, of 120 tons, thus

(   277 )    The site he had chosen--a recently straightened part of the new and

(   278 )    fashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above

(   281 )    afford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child

(   288 )    trouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of a

(   290 )    for Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following

(   292 )    weakness; and would have returned to his father's farm in Rehoboth but

(   295 )    death of William Harris himself, enfeebled as he was by the climate of

(   296 )    Martinique, where his occupation had kept him for considerable periods

(   299 )    The widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered from the shock of her husband's

(   300 )    death, and the passing of her first-born Elkanah two years later was the

(   302 )    insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house;

(   304 )    the family. Mercy was a plain, raw-boned woman of great strength; but

(   305 )    her health visibly declined from the time of her advent. She was greatly

(   311 )    smell of the place. For a time Mercy could secure no more help, since

(   312 )    the seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within five years'

(   313 )    space, had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumor which later

(   315 )    out of town; Ann White, a morose woman from that part of North Kingstown

(   316 )    now set off as the township of Exeter, and a capable Boston man named

(   323 )    Nooseneck Hill country, for that remote bit of backwoods was then, as

(   324 )    now, a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions. As lately as 1892

(   327 )    public health and peace, and one may imagine the point of view of the

(   333 )    imaginings of the most hideous sort. At times her screams became

(   339 )    Peleg. Just what Mrs. Harris cried out in her fits of violence,

(   343 )    French often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that

(   345 )    of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her. In 1772 the servant

(   346 )    Zenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she laughed with a shocking

(   350 )    Upon the outbreak of trouble with Great Britain in 1775, William Harris,

(   352 )    enlist in the Army of Observation under General Greene; and from that

(   355 )    he met and married Phebe Hetfield of Elizabethtown, whom he brought to

(   358 )    The young soldier's return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness. The

(   364 )    remaining servant Maria. In the autumn of 1782 Phebe Harris gave birth

(   365 )    to a still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth of the next May Mercy

(   366 )    Dexter took leave of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.

(   368 )    William Harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radically

(   369 )    unhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it and

(   372 )    of a new and finer house in Westminster Street, in the growing part of

(   373 )    the town across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785, his son Dutee was

(   374 )    born; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce

(   378 )    and Phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, but Dutee

(   383 )    to his ward to make the most of all the boy's property, nor did he

(   385 )    changes of tenants, or the steadily growing aversion with which the

(   388 )    sulfur, tar, and gum camphor on account of the much-discussed deaths of

(   389 )    four persons, presumably caused by the then diminishing fever epidemic.

(   392 )    Dutee himself thought little of the house, for he grew up to be a

(   394 )    Captain Cahoone in the War of 1812. He returned unharmed, married in

(   395 )    1814, and became a father on that memorable night of September 23, 1815,

(   396 )    when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town, and

(   402 )    Fredericksburg in 1862. Neither he nor his son Archer knew of the

(   404 )    rent--perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odor of unkempt old

(   405 )    age. Indeed, it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating in

(   406 )    1861, which the excitement of the war tended to throw into obscurity.

(   407 )    Carrington Harris, last of the male line, knew it only as a deserted and

(   408 )    somewhat picturesque center of legend until I told him my experience. He

(   418 )    the Harrises. In this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a

(   422 )    miscellaneous data--legends transcribed from servant gossip, cuttings

(   423 )    from the papers, copies of death certificates by fellow-physicians, and

(   424 )    the like. All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was a

(   429 )    and malodorous _cellar_ of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence.

(   433 )    of mold in that region. These latter narratives interested me

(   434 )    profoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt that

(   435 )    most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by

(   436 )    additions from the common stock of local ghost lore.

(   440 )    there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires--the dead

(   441 )    who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the

(   452 )    other things--the complaint of the departing servant Preserved Smith,

(   453 )    who had preceded Ann and never heard of her, that something "sucked his

(   454 )    breath" at night; the death-certificates of the fever victims of 1804,

(   456 )    unaccountably lacking in blood; and the obscure passages of poor Rhoby

(   457 )    Harris's ravings, where she complained of the sharp teeth of a

(   461 )    me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated

(   463 )    _Providence Gazette and Country-Journal_ of April 12, 1815, and the

(   464 )    other from the _Daily Transcript and Chronicle_ of October 27,

(   465 )    1845--each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose

(   468 )    schoolteacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in

(   470 )    the attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final case

(   471 )    which put an end to the renting of the house--a series of anemia deaths

(   473 )    attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrist.

(   476 )    practise; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his

(   481 )    to any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris nearly a century

(   484 )    from the war, to the first-hand account of Doctors Chase and Whitmarsh.

(   486 )    that he was glad of my own interest--an open-minded and sympathetic

(   490 )    worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and

(   496 )    Harris, then owner of the house, many times before his death in 1916;

(   498 )    authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected.

(   503 )    might have shed a little light. The old seaman, who had survived his son

(   506 )    seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird

(   507 )    significance to the French raving of Rhoby Harris, which she had so

(   508 )    often heard during the last days of that hapless woman. Maria had been

(   509 )    at the shunned house from 1769 till the removal of the family in 1783,

(   510 )    and had seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she hinted to the child Dutee of a

(   520 )    Having exhausted the Harris family of all the information it could

(   523 )    the same work. What I wished was a comprehensive history of the site

(   526 )    start, that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot granted

(   527 )    originally to John Throckmorton; one of many similar strips beginning at

(   530 )    lot had later, of course, been much subdivided; and I became very

(   537 )    Then suddenly I came--by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in the

(   538 )    main body of records and might easily have been missed--upon something

(   540 )    the queerest phases of the affair. It was the record of a lease, in

(   541 )    1697, of a small tract of ground to an Etienne Roulet and wife. At last

(   543 )    horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weird

(   544 )    and heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly studied the platting of the

(   546 )    straightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found what I had

(   549 )    no record of any transfer of graves existed. The document, indeed, ended

(   552 )    which the name of Etienne Roulet would unlock. In the end I did find

(   553 )    something; something of such vague but monstrous import that I set about

(   554 )    at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new and

(   558 )    west shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude, and had

(   561 )    whither they had come in 1686, after the revocation of the Edict of

(   562 )    Nantes, and rumor said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mere

(   567 )    village down the bay, had moved the sympathy of the town fathers. Here

(   572 )    a riot of some sort later on--perhaps forty years later, after old

(   573 )    Roulet's death--and no one seemed to hear of the family after that.

(   577 )    life of a New England seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whose

(   579 )    family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence

(   580 )    never shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbors, it was

(   583 )    undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins.

(   584 )    What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other

(   585 )    inhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone

(   586 )    could determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legends

(   588 )    had given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which

(   589 )    tells of the creature _Jacques Roulet, of Caude_, who in 1598 was

(   592 )    with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and

(   593 )    rending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope away

(   596 )    generally known of it. Had they known, the coincidence of names would

(   605 )    building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor.

(   612 )    above-ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked

(   615 )    faint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on the

(   619 )    At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot

(   620 )    nocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch

(   624 )    the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the "huddled

(   630 )    Above the anthropomorphic patch of mold by the fireplace it rose; a

(   632 )    dampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form,

(   634 )    blackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake. It was truly

(   635 )    horrible, and the more so to me because of what I knew of the spot.

(   639 )    hour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision. Weighing

(   640 )    in his mind the importance of the matter, and the significance of our

(   642 )    destroy--the horror of the house by a joint night or nights of

(   643 )    aggressive vigil in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.

(   648 )    On Wednesday, June 25, 1919, after a proper notification of Carrington

(   651 )    camp cot, together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight and

(   663 )    the laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armory, and

(   664 )    instinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvelous

(   665 )    commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of

(   666 )    eighty-one. Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he

(   670 )    owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. Then too,

(   671 )    we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my

(   676 )    To declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching

(   679 )    and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions

(   680 )    embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance and

(   681 )    energy. In this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from

(   682 )    numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of certain

(   683 )    forces of great power and, so far as the human point of view is

(   687 )    certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and

(   689 )    because of its more intimate connection with other spatial units, yet

(   690 )    close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional

(   691 )    manifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may never

(   695 )    of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house;

(   696 )    traceable to one or another of the ill-favored French settlers of two

(   698 )    atomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed an

(   699 )    abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity--dark spheres which for

(   701 )    seemed to prove. Had not, then, the riots of those bygone

(   703 )    brain of one or more of them--notably the sinister Paul Roulet--which

(   706 )    original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the

(   710 )    the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity

(   712 )    substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible

(   714 )    fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates

(   717 )    self-preservation. In any case such a monster must of necessity be in

(   718 )    our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation forms

(   722 )    What baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might

(   725 )    the realm of substance--or it might be partly material; some unknown and

(   726 )    equivocal mass of plasticity, capable of changing at will to nebulous

(   727 )    approximations of the solid, liquid, gaseous, or tenuously unparticled

(   728 )    states. The anthropomorphic patch of mold on the floor, the form of the

(   729 )    yellowish vapor, and the curvature of the tree-roots in some of the old

(   732 )    be, none could say with any kind of certainty.

(   740 )    military flame-throwers of the sort used in the World War, in case it

(   741 )    proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction--for

(   750 )    limned form--but then I thought of the legends.

(   753 )    continued we found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak,

(   756 )    stone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; the

(   758 )    the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and

(   760 )    the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and

(   761 )    chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase

(   763 )    blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence

(   764 )    of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven--these

(   769 )    unlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open

(   770 )    in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with. It was our idea

(   772 )    entity lurked there; and that being prepared, we could dispose of the

(   773 )    thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we had

(   779 )    of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat our

(   780 )    entire purpose. Such was our frame of mind as we talked--far into the

(   788 )    punctuated by another nerve-racking sound of distant dripping water

(   791 )    of the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in from

(   793 )    atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and

(   797 )    apprehension.

(   799 )    Then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had

(   800 )    turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the

(   802 )    occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities

(   803 )    of a choking moan.

(   806 )    rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the

(   809 )    merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature

(   810 )    of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in

(   814 )    all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and

(   815 )    well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling

(   819 )    many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself.

(   823 )    All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his

(   826 )    which filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle's

(   834 )    leaped abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry in

(   836 )    Then the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of facial

(   838 )    relate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with a

(   839 )    kind of awe.

(   842 )    dream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he

(   843 )    had ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it--a shadowy

(   844 )    geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar things

(   846 )    of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon another; an

(   847 )    arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space seemed

(   849 )    vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snap-shots, if one might use

(   850 )    the term, of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity.

(   853 )    of angry faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hats

(   854 )    frowning down on him. Again he seemed to be in the interior of a

(   856 )    constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the

(   857 )    furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in

(   858 )    just as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects. It

(   860 )    half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange

(   861 )    faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family. And

(   862 )    all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some

(   864 )    possess itself of his vital processes.

(   866 )    I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were

(   867 )    by eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown

(   868 )    forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid;

(   872 )    our minds to the exclusion of all else.

(   874 )    Conversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and

(   876 )    seemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even though

(   877 )    the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours.

(   879 )    Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the

(   883 )    yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My uncle's face

(   887 )    which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and

(   895 )    this sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the

(   896 )    window, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room,

(   898 )    than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside. It was

(   900 )    enough to read an average book by. But it cast a shadow of myself and

(   903 )    sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently

(   904 )    assailed. For on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking

(   914 )    beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable

(   916 )    Out of the fungus-ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light,

(   921 )    stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up the

(   925 )    cloud of fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and dissolving to an

(   932 )    It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled

(   936 )    loomed on my left, I threw on the current of the Crookes tube apparatus,

(   937 )    and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the strongest

(   939 )    of nature. There was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering, and the

(   941 )    was only that of contrast, and that the waves from the machine had no

(   944 )    Then, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror

(   946 )    toward that unlocked door to the quiet street, careless of what abnormal

(   947 )    terrors I loosed upon the world, or what thoughts or judgments of men I

(   948 )    brought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form

(   949 )    of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes

(   951 )    such changes of identity as only madness can conceive. He was at once a

(   955 )    melted like tallow, in the caricatured likeness of legions strange and

(   958 )    I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult and

(   961 )    counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen in

(   962 )    the School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught the

(   963 )    raw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting in

(   965 )    the last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered

(   966 )    close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was

(   968 )    themselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncle's kindly

(   971 )    parched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of grease

(   986 )    swung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom I

(   989 )    The grease was gone, for the moldy floor was porous. And in front of the

(   990 )    fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up form traced in niter.

(   992 )    the yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could

(  1001 )    some vampirish vapor such as Exeter rustics tell of as lurking over

(  1008 )    a spade, a military gas-mask, and six carboys of sulfuric acid, all to

(  1009 )    be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house in

(  1011 )    hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract my

(  1015 )    and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the

(  1016 )    unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling

(  1019 )    toward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front of the

(  1021 )    white fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of what

(  1022 )    I might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind,

(  1023 )    and this seemed to me one of them.

(  1026 )    the large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was

(  1028 )    my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed

(  1031 )    waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the

(  1033 )    of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty

(  1037 )    nameless thing at the bottom of a pit.

(  1040 )    made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as

(  1042 )    light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was

(  1043 )    fishy and glassy--a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions

(  1044 )    of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was

(  1045 )    a rift where a part of the substance was folded over. The exposed area

(  1048 )    Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and

(  1056 )    The blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapor which surged

(  1057 )    tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, will

(  1058 )    never leave my memory. All along the hill people tell of the yellow day,

(  1061 )    They tell, too, of the hideous roar which at the same time came from

(  1070 )    was twilight before I was done, but fear had gone out of the place. The

(  1072 )    kind of harmless grayish powder which blew ash-like along the floor. One

(  1073 )    of earth's nethermost terrors had perished for ever; and if there be a

(  1074 )    hell, it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed thing. And

(  1075 )    as I patted down the last spadeful of mold, I shed the first of the many

(    79 )    The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract the

(   163 )    falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered

(   164 )    furniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of

(   165 )    the fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend

(   167 )    blinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage

(   168 )    of chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit

(   235 )    records of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions

(   244 )    tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even

(   247 )    hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared

(   248 )    to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate.

(   250 )    The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that

(   263 )    prosperous and honorable family who built it. Yet from the first a taint

(   266 )    structure in 1763, and followed the theme with an unusual amount of

(   268 )    Harris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in

(   269 )    1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born

(   270 )    in 1761. Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India

(   271 )    trade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After

(   278 )    fashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above

(   279 )    crowded Cheapside--was all that could be wished, and the building did

(   281 )    afford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child

(   284 )    century and a half.

(   286 )    The next April, sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and

(   287 )    Ruth died before the month was over. Doctor Job Ives diagnosed the

(   292 )    weakness; and would have returned to his father's farm in Rehoboth but

(   300 )    death, and the passing of her first-born Elkanah two years later was the

(   302 )    insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house;

(   306 )    devoted to her unfortunate sister, and had an especial affection for her

(   308 )    sickly, spindling lad. In this year the servant Mehitabel died, and the

(   310 )    least, with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked the

(   312 )    the seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within five years'

(   327 )    public health and peace, and one may imagine the point of view of the

(   334 )    insupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors

(   337 )    would seem to improve after these visits, and had Mercy been as wise as

(   343 )    French often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that

(   344 )    language, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildly

(   345 )    of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her. In 1772 the servant

(   346 )    Zenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she laughed with a shocking

(   347 )    delight utterly foreign to her. The next year she herself died, and was

(   351 )    despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution, managed to

(   352 )    enlist in the Army of Observation under General Greene; and from that

(   353 )    time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige. In 1780, as a

(   359 )    house, it is true, was still in good condition; and the street had been

(   360 )    widened and changed in name from Back Street to Benefit Street. But

(   361 )    Mercy Dexter's once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious decay,

(   362 )    so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice and

(   363 )    disconcerting pallor--qualities shared to a singular degree by the one

(   365 )    to a still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth of the next May Mercy

(   366 )    Dexter took leave of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.

(   538 )    main body of records and might easily have been missed--upon something

(   541 )    1697, of a small tract of ground to an Etienne Roulet and wife. At last

(   542 )    the French element had appeared--that, and another deeper element of

(   544 )    and heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly studied the platting of the

(   545 )    locality as it had been before the cutting through and partial

(   546 )    straightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found what I had

(   548 )    laid out their graveyard behind a one-story and attic cottage, and that

(   550 )    in much confusion; and I was forced to ransack both the Rhode Island

(   551 )    Historical Society and Shepley Library before I could find a local door

(   558 )    west shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude, and had

(   569 )    less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer

(   573 )    Roulet's death--and no one seemed to hear of the family after that.

(   575 )    For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well

(   576 )    remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet

(   579 )    family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence

(   592 )    with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and

(   593 )    rending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope away

(   595 )    name and place; but I decided that the Providence gossips could not have

(   597 )    have brought some drastic and frightened action--indeed, might not its

(   605 )    building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor.

(   609 )    dark stairs, ground-floor hall, and front door could give. There, where

(   610 )    morbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during long

(   612 )    above-ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked

(   615 )    faint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on the

(   616 )    floor--and I fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously

(   620 )    nocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch

(   621 )    over the moldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted,

(   623 )    evening, and I was almost prepared when I saw--or thought I saw--amidst

(   626 )    unprecedented--and as I watched I seemed to see again the thin,

(   632 )    dampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form,

(   633 )    gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into the

(   635 )    horrible, and the more so to me because of what I knew of the spot.

(   636 )    Refusing to flee, I watched it fade--and as I watched I felt that it was

(   638 )    When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense

(   639 )    hour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision. Weighing

(   640 )    in his mind the importance of the matter, and the significance of our

(   641 )    relation to it, he insisted that we both test--and if possible

(   643 )    aggressive vigil in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.

(   650 )    uncle and I conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding

(   652 )    intricacy. These we placed in the cellar during the day, screening the

(   653 )    windows with paper and planning to return in the evening for our first

(   655 )    having a key to the outside cellar door, were prepared to leave our

(   656 )    expensive and delicate apparatus--which we had obtained secretly and at

(   658 )    design to sit up together till very late, and then watch singly till

(   659 )    dawn in two-hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; the

(   663 )    the laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armory, and

(   664 )    instinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvelous

(   665 )    commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of

(   667 )    had preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would be

(   669 )    happen--Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris because he

(   670 )    owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. Then too,

(   671 )    we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my

(   672 )    uncle's going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally

(   674 )    me, and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house.

(   677 )    would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous. We were not, as I

(   679 )    and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions

(   681 )    energy. In this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from

(   683 )    forces of great power and, so far as the human point of view is

(   687 )    certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and

(   688 )    attenuated matter; existing very infrequently in three-dimensional space

(   694 )    In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array

(   697 )    centuries before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of

(   698 )    atomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed an

(   700 )    normal folk hold only repulsion and terror--their recorded history

(   704 )    obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob, and

(   705 )    continued to function in some multiple-dimensioned space along the

(   711 )    and intra-atomic action. One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of

(   714 )    fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates

(   715 )    and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself. It might be

(   718 )    our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation forms

(   720 )    and sanity.

(   723 )    encounter the thing. No sane person had ever seen it, and few had ever

(   724 )    felt it definitely. It might be pure energy--a form ethereal and outside

(   726 )    equivocal mass of plasticity, capable of changing at will to nebulous

(   729 )    yellowish vapor, and the curvature of the tree-roots in some of the old

(   730 )    tales, all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connection with the

(   736 )    We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted

(   737 )    Crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with

(   738 )    peculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible and

(   739 )    opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair of

(   741 )    proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction--for

(   745 )    reference to the cot and chairs, and to the spot before the fireplace

(   748 )    instruments, and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil. For

(   752 )    Our cellar vigil began at ten p. m., daylight saving time, and as it

(   754 )    filtered glow from the rain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a feeble

(   757 )    dank, fetid and mildew-tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi;

(   758 )    the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and

(   759 )    other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams of

(   761 )    chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase

(   762 )    with ruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of

(   764 )    of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven--these

(   765 )    things, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate

(   769 )    unlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open

(   772 )    entity lurked there; and that being prepared, we could dispose of the

(   774 )    recognized and observed it sufficiently. How long it might require to

(   775 )    evoke and extinguish the thing, we had no notion. It occurred to us,

(   778 )    and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that the seeking

(   779 )    of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat our

(   787 )    deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, and

(   788 )    punctuated by another nerve-racking sound of distant dripping water

(   789 )    within--for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and in

(   791 )    of the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in from

(   792 )    the street through the screened window; and once, when the noisome

(   794 )    looked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights and

(   795 )    my nostrils on wholesome air. Still nothing occurred to reward my

(   796 )    watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of

(   805 )    I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; so

(   806 )    rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the

(   810 )    of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in

(   813 )    situation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not at

(   815 )    well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling

(   817 )    chiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing

(   818 )    perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but

(   819 )    many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself.

(   823 )    All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his

(   824 )    mouth and teeth as he spoke. The words were at first indistinguishable,

(   825 )    and then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about them

(   827 )    education and the interminable translations he had made from

(   828 )    anthropological and antiquarian articles in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.

(   829 )    For the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering _in French_, and the few

(   833 )    Suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper's forehead, and he

(   835 )    English, and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, "My breath, my breath!"

(   836 )    Then the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of facial

(   837 )    expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began to

(   843 )    had ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it--a shadowy

(   845 )    in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. There was a suggestion

(   848 )    dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopic

(   853 )    of angry faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hats

(   855 )    house--an old house, apparently--but the details and inhabitants were

(   856 )    constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the

(   857 )    furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in

(   859 )    was queer--damnably queer--and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if

(   862 )    all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some

(   863 )    pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought to

(   868 )    forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid;

(   869 )    but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that

(   871 )    reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled

(   875 )    in time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle

(   876 )    seemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even though

(   879 )    Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the

(   880 )    most disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal

(   882 )    lay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing

(   884 )    came to me with less pleasant association than in waking hours, and I

(   885 )    recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a

(   886 )    pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek

(   887 )    which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and

(   888 )    startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out

(   889 )    with more than natural clearness and reality.

(   896 )    window, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room,

(   901 )    the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hinted

(   907 )    almost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp the

(   910 )    scream had been in my uncle's voice, and I knew not against what menace

(   911 )    I should have to defend him and myself.

(   914 )    beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable

(   915 )    hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few.

(   917 )    yellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in

(   918 )    vague outlines half human and half monstrous, through which I could see

(   919 )    the chimney and fireplace beyond. It was all eyes--wolfish and

(   920 )    mocking--and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at the top to a thin

(   921 )    stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up the

(   925 )    cloud of fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and dissolving to an

(   928 )    with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me, and

(   929 )    reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror had

(   933 )    myself in preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training saved

(   935 )    material chemistry, and therefore ignoring the flame-thrower which

(   937 )    and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the strongest

(   938 )    ether radiations which man's art can arouse from the spaces and fluids

(   939 )    of nature. There was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering, and the

(   941 )    was only that of contrast, and that the waves from the machine had no

(   945 )    which brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering

(   948 )    brought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form

(   950 )    all description, and in which there played across his vanishing face

(   952 )    devil and a multitude, a charnel-house and a pageant. Lit by the mixed

(   953 )    and uncertain beams, that gelatinous face assumed a dozen--a score--a

(   956 )    yet not strange.

(   958 )    I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult and

(   959 )    infantile, and other features old and young, coarse and refined,

(   960 )    familiar and unfamiliar. For a second there flashed a degraded

(   962 )    the School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught the

(   965 )    the last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered

(   968 )    themselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncle's kindly

(   969 )    face. I like to think that he existed at that moment, and that he tried

(   976 )    The rest is shadowy and monstrous. There was no one in the soaking

(   977 )    street, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked

(   978 )    aimlessly south past College Hill and the Athenæum, down Hopkins Street,

(   979 )    and over the bridge to the business section where tall buildings seemed

(   981 )    unwholesome wonder. Then gray dawn unfolded wetly from the east,

(   982 )    silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples, and beckoning

(   983 )    me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished. And in the

(   984 )    end I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light, and entered

(   985 )    that awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar, and which still

(   989 )    The grease was gone, for the moldy floor was porous. And in front of the

(   992 )    the yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could

(   993 )    scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality. Then thought

(   994 )    trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than

(   998 )    just what had happened, and how I might end the horror, if indeed it had

(  1002 )    certain churchyards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at the

(  1003 )    floor before the fireplace where the mold and niter had taken strange

(  1006 )    In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for

(  1007 )    home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,

(  1008 )    a spade, a military gas-mask, and six carboys of sulfuric acid, all to

(  1010 )    Benefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed the

(  1011 )    hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract my

(  1015 )    and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the

(  1017 )    anybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because

(  1023 )    and this seemed to me one of them.

(  1027 )    about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of

(  1029 )    the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look

(  1030 )    like--what its form and substance would be, and how big it might have

(  1032 )    hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the great carboys

(  1033 )    of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty

(  1035 )    earth only along the other two sides; working more slowly and donning my

(  1040 )    made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as

(  1041 )    my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the

(  1043 )    fishy and glassy--a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions

(  1044 )    of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was

(  1046 )    was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft blue-white

(  1048 )    Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and

(  1049 )    away from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy

(  1050 )    carboys, and precipitating their corrosive contents one after another

(  1051 )    down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose titan

(  1059 )    when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped in

(  1069 )    after a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It

(  1071 )    dampness was less fetid, and all the strange fungi had withered to a

(  1073 )    of earth's nethermost terrors had perished for ever; and if there be a

(   638 )    When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense

(   657 )    great cost--as many days as our vigils might be protracted. It was our

(   801 )    first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity,

(   810 )    of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in

(   811 )    itself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle's facial

(   814 )    all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and

(   816 )    within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this _variety_ which

(   829 )    For the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering _in French_, and the few

(   842 )    dream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he

(   843 )    had ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it--a shadowy

(   845 )    in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. There was a suggestion

(   859 )    was queer--damnably queer--and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if

(   862 )    all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some

(   879 )    Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the

(   885 )    recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a

(   886 )    pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek

(   899 )    not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong

(   909 )    before the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for the

(   913 )    Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors

(   914 )    beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable

(   924 )    form. At the time, it was to me only a seething, dimly phosphorescent

(   941 )    was only that of contrast, and that the waves from the machine had no

(   951 )    such changes of identity as only madness can conceive. He was at once a

(   964 )    Carrington Harris's house. It was frightful beyond conception; toward

(   967 )    spreading, it seemed as though the shifting features fought against

(   976 )    The rest is shadowy and monstrous. There was no one in the soaking

(   977 )    street, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked

(   983 )    me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished. And in the

(  1015 )    and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the

(  1016 )    unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling

(  1027 )    about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of

(  1036 )    gas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a
