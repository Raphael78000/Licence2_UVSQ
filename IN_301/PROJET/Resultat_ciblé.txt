(    40 )     _A posthumous story of immense power, written by a master of weird

(    41 )       fiction--a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old

(    50 )        weird fiction. His ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding

(    58 )    latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of

(    66 )    gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination.

(    70 )    particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated

(    71 )    structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkempt

(    72 )    yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country. It does

(    77 )    stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous.

(    79 )    The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract the

(    80 )    attention of the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm building, it

(    87 )    construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the grading

(    89 )    Street--at first called Back Street--was laid out as a lane winding

(    95 )    precipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at about

(    97 )    exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made,

(    98 )    giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window above

(   101 )    and Poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull gray

(   102 )    brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet by

(   111 )    a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a

(   112 )    steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon-like

(   132 )    forgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modern

(   140 )    dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more

(   148 )    decline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the salubriousness

(   161 )    windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round

(   166 )    the ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by small

(   167 )    blinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage

(   174 )    only a thin door and window-pierced brick wall to separate it from the

(   191 )    which was, however, merely suggestive at most. I refer to a sort of

(   192 )    cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor--a vague, shifting deposit of

(   195 )    Once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance

(   196 )    to a doubled-up human figure, though generally no such kinship existed,

(   199 )    On a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally

(   200 )    strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin,

(   204 )    reminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some of

(   205 )    the wild ancient tales of the common folk--a notion likewise alluding to

(   215 )    a sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for all his

(   217 )    the abnormal. His own view, postulating simply a building and location

(   224 )    gentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lance

(   226 )    Thomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one man-servant in a Georgian

(   229 )    colony house where his grandfather--a cousin of that celebrated

(   241 )    my uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough

(   243 )    of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding,

(   247 )    hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared

(   263 )    prosperous and honorable family who built it. Yet from the first a taint

(   281 )    afford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child

(   282 )    which the family expected. That child, a boy, came in December; but was

(   289 )    mere wasting-away or decline. It seemed, in any event, to be contagious;

(   293 )    for a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was hired to succeed

(   294 )    Hannah. He died the next year--a sad year indeed, since it marked the

(   301 )    final blow to her reason. In 1768 she fell victim to a mild form of

(   304 )    the family. Mercy was a plain, raw-boned woman of great strength; but

(   307 )    only surviving nephew William, who from a sturdy infant had become a

(   308 )    sickly, spindling lad. In this year the servant Mehitabel died, and the

(   310 )    least, with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked the

(   311 )    smell of the place. For a time Mercy could secure no more help, since

(   315 )    out of town; Ann White, a morose woman from that part of North Kingstown

(   316 )    now set off as the township of Exeter, and a capable Boston man named

(   324 )    now, a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions. As lately as 1892

(   325 )    an Exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its

(   329 )    few months Mercy discharged her, filling her place with a faithful and

(   342 )    it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of

(   343 )    French often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that

(   345 )    of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her. In 1772 the servant

(   346 )    Zenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she laughed with a shocking

(   353 )    time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige. In 1780, as a

(   354 )    captain in the Rhode Island forces in New Jersey under Colonel Angell,

(   358 )    The young soldier's return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness. The

(   361 )    Mercy Dexter's once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious decay,

(   362 )    so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice and

(   363 )    disconcerting pallor--qualities shared to a singular degree by the one

(   365 )    to a still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth of the next May Mercy

(   366 )    Dexter took leave of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.

(   405 )    age. Indeed, it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating in

(   407 )    Carrington Harris, last of the male line, knew it only as a deserted and

(   419 )    persistent evil beyond anything in nature as I had known it; an evil

(   425 )    tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house;

(   429 )    and malodorous _cellar_ of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence.

(   443 )    abroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the grandmothers say,

(   444 )    exhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through that

(   445 )    organ; and Ann's dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been

(   461 )    me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated

(   467 )    person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 a

(   468 )    schoolteacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in

(   469 )    a horrible way, glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of

(   471 )    which put an end to the renting of the house--a series of anemia deaths

(   480 )    maledictions in French, a language they could not possibly have studied

(   481 )    to any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris nearly a century

(   503 )    might have shed a little light. The old seaman, who had survived his son

(   506 )    seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird

(   511 )    somewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last moments, but he had soon

(   522 )    zeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown in

(   523 )    the same work. What I wished was a comprehensive history of the site

(   529 )    line roughly corresponding with the modern Hope Street. The Throckmorton

(   537 )    Then suddenly I came--by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in the

(   540 )    the queerest phases of the affair. It was the record of a lease, in

(   541 )    1697, of a small tract of ground to an Etienne Roulet and wife. At last

(   548 )    laid out their graveyard behind a one-story and attic cottage, and that

(   551 )    Historical Society and Shepley Library before I could find a local door

(   554 )    at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new and

(   568 )    the strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy Etienne Roulet,

(   570 )    diagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at Pardon

(   572 )    a riot of some sort later on--perhaps forty years later, after old

(   575 )    For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well

(   577 )    life of a New England seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whose

(   579 )    family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence

(   590 )    condemned to death as a demoniac but afterward saved from the stake by

(   591 )    the Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. He had been found covered

(   592 )    with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and

(   593 )    rending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope away

(   594 )    unhurt. Surely a pretty hearthside tale, with a queer significance as to

(   606 )    Finally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the

(   608 )    preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than the

(   612 )    above-ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked

(   613 )    door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside.

(   619 )    At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot

(   624 )    the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the "huddled

(   631 )    subtle, sickish, almost luminous vapor which as it hung trembling in the

(   634 )    blackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake. It was truly

(   638 )    When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense

(   639 )    hour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision. Weighing

(   665 )    commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of

(   685 )    vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement. Rather

(   709 )    Such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in

(   710 )    the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity

(   717 )    self-preservation. In any case such a monster must of necessity be in

(   719 )    a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world's life, health,

(   724 )    felt it definitely. It might be pure energy--a form ethereal and outside

(   730 )    tales, all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connection with the

(   736 )    We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted

(   739 )    opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair of

(   749 )    a moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in the more definitely

(   753 )    continued we found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak,

(   754 )    filtered glow from the rain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a feeble

(   764 )    of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven--these

(   769 )    unlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open

(   785 )    alone--I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;

(   802 )    occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities

(   803 )    of a choking moan.

(   815 )    well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling

(   819 )    many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself.

(   825 )    and then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about them

(   833 )    Suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper's forehead, and he

(   834 )    leaped abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry in

(   839 )    kind of awe.

(   841 )    He had, he said, floated off from a very ordinary series of

(   842 )    dream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he

(   843 )    had ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it--a shadowy

(   845 )    in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. There was a suggestion

(   852 )    Once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd

(   855 )    house--an old house, apparently--but the details and inhabitants were

(   858 )    just as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects. It

(   862 )    all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some

(   880 )    most disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal

(   886 )    pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek

(   887 )    which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and

(   897 )    all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighter

(   899 )    not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong

(   900 )    enough to read an average book by. But it cast a shadow of myself and

(   901 )    the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hinted

(   916 )    Out of the fungus-ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light,

(   917 )    yellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in

(   920 )    mocking--and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at the top to a thin

(   924 )    form. At the time, it was to me only a seething, dimly phosphorescent

(   932 )    It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled

(   939 )    of nature. There was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering, and the

(   944 )    Then, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror

(   949 )    of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes

(   952 )    devil and a multitude, a charnel-house and a pageant. Lit by the mixed

(   953 )    and uncertain beams, that gelatinous face assumed a dozen--a score--a

(   954 )    hundred--aspects; grinning, as it sank to the ground on a body that

(   960 )    familiar and unfamiliar. For a second there flashed a degraded

(   961 )    counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen in

(   963 )    raw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting in

(   965 )    the last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered

(   966 )    close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was

(   970 )    to bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccupped a farewell from my own

(   971 )    parched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of grease

(  1007 )    home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,

(  1008 )    a spade, a military gas-mask, and six carboys of sulfuric acid, all to

(  1014 )    At eleven a. m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather,

(  1020 )    fireplace, my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from the

(  1025 )    My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in

(  1029 )    the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look

(  1037 )    nameless thing at the bottom of a pit.

(  1040 )    made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as

(  1043 )    fishy and glassy--a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions

(  1045 )    a rift where a part of the substance was folded over. The exposed area

(  1046 )    was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft blue-white

(  1069 )    after a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It

(  1072 )    kind of harmless grayish powder which blew ash-like along the floor. One

(  1074 )    hell, it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed thing. And

(  1082 )    me, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn

(  1083 )    down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building. The

(   252 )    the last my uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, and

(   253 )    after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me. I am

(   255 )    honor, virtue, good taste, benevolence, and learning. I have reared a

(   408 )    somewhat picturesque center of legend until I told him my experience. He

(   417 )    It may well be imagined how powerfully I was affected by the annals of

(   419 )    persistent evil beyond anything in nature as I had known it; an evil

(   424 )    the like. All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was a

(   426 )    but I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their

(   434 )    profoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt that

(   460 )    Free from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in

(   485 )    Indeed, I could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject, and

(   493 )    For my part, I was disposed to take the whole subject with profound

(   495 )    accumulate as much more as I could. I talked with the elderly Archer

(   499 )    When, however, I asked them what connection with France or its language

(   501 )    ignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and all that Miss Harris could say

(   515 )    son Carrington, the present owner, with whom I talked after my

(   521 )    furnish, I turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a

(   523 )    the same work. What I wished was a comprehensive history of the site

(   525 )    Indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data. I found, at the

(   530 )    lot had later, of course, been much subdivided; and I became very

(   533 )    graveyard; but as I examined the records more carefully, I found that

(   537 )    Then suddenly I came--by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in the

(   544 )    and heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly studied the platting of the

(   546 )    straightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found what I had

(   550 )    in much confusion; and I was forced to ransack both the Rhode Island

(   551 )    Historical Society and Shepley Library before I could find a local door

(   552 )    which the name of Etienne Roulet would unlock. In the end I did find

(   553 )    something; something of such vague but monstrous import that I set about

(   586 )    could determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legends

(   595 )    name and place; but I decided that the Providence gossips could not have

(   603 )    I now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the

(   606 )    Finally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the

(   610 )    morbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during long

(   616 )    floor--and I fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously

(   619 )    At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot

(   623 )    evening, and I was almost prepared when I saw--or thought I saw--amidst

(   625 )    form" I had suspected from boyhood. Its clearness was astonishing and

(   626 )    unprecedented--and as I watched I seemed to see again the thin,

(   635 )    horrible, and the more so to me because of what I knew of the spot.

(   636 )    Refusing to flee, I watched it fade--and as I watched I felt that it was

(   638 )    When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense

(   650 )    uncle and I conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding

(   669 )    happen--Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris because he

(   671 )    we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my

(   678 )    have said, in any sense childishly superstitious, but scientific study

(   749 )    a moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in the more definitely

(   750 )    limned form--but then I thought of the legends.

(   784 )    Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours

(   785 )    alone--I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;

(   790 )    this storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, antique masonry

(   793 )    atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and

(   796 )    watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of

(   805 )    I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; so

(   806 )    rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the

(   807 )    light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most

(   816 )    within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this _variety_ which

(   823 )    All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his

(   825 )    and then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about them

(   826 )    which filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle's

(   830 )    phrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he

(   838 )    relate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with a

(   866 )    I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were

(   875 )    in time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle

(   879 )    Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the

(   880 )    most disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal

(   882 )    lay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing

(   885 )    recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a

(   886 )    pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek

(   894 )    I had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that in

(   895 )    this sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the

(   902 )    at things more potent than luminosity. This I perceived with unhealthy

(   907 )    almost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp the

(   909 )    before the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for the

(   910 )    scream had been in my uncle's voice, and I knew not against what menace

(   911 )    I should have to defend him and myself.

(   913 )    Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors

(   918 )    vague outlines half human and half monstrous, through which I could see

(   922 )    chimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is only in conscious

(   923 )    retrospection that I ever definitely traced its damnable approach to

(   932 )    It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled

(   936 )    loomed on my left, I threw on the current of the Crookes tube apparatus,

(   940 )    yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes. But I saw the dimness

(   944 )    Then, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horror

(   947 )    terrors I loosed upon the world, or what thoughts or judgments of men I

(   948 )    brought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form

(   958 )    I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult and

(   961 )    counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen in

(   962 )    the School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught the

(   963 )    raw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting in

(   969 )    face. I like to think that he existed at that moment, and that he tried

(   970 )    to bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccupped a farewell from my own

(   971 )    parched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of grease

(   977 )    street, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walked

(   984 )    end I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light, and entered

(   985 )    that awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar, and which still

(   987 )    dared not speak.

(   991 )    I looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, and

(   992 )    the yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could

(   994 )    trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than

(   995 )    I had dreamed.

(   997 )    Sitting down, I tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me

(   998 )    just what had happened, and how I might end the horror, if indeed it had

(  1002 )    certain churchyards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at the

(  1006 )    In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for

(  1007 )    home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,

(  1010 )    Benefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed the

(  1014 )    At eleven a. m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather,

(  1015 )    and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the

(  1016 )    unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling

(  1017 )    anybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because

(  1019 )    toward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front of the

(  1021 )    white fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of what

(  1022 )    I might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind,

(  1025 )    My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in

(  1026 )    the large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was

(  1027 )    about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of

(  1029 )    the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look

(  1031 )    waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the

(  1033 )    of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty

(  1034 )    them all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I dumped

(  1036 )    gas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a

(  1039 )    Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and

(  1041 )    my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the

(  1042 )    light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was

(  1044 )    of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was

(  1048 )    Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and

(  1052 )    _elbow_ I had seen.

(  1060 )    the Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to the source.

(  1062 )    some disordered water-pipe or gas main underground--but again I could

(  1063 )    correct them if I dared. It was unspeakably shocking, and I do not see

(  1064 )    how I lived through it. I did faint after emptying the fourth carboy,

(  1065 )    which I had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask;

(  1066 )    but when I recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapors.

(  1068 )    The two remaining carboys I emptied down without particular result, and

(  1069 )    after a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. It

(  1070 )    was twilight before I was done, but fear had gone out of the place. The

(  1075 )    as I patted down the last spadeful of mold, I shed the first of the many

(  1076 )    tears with which I have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle's

(  1082 )    me, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn
