house by h p 


lovecraft a posthumous story of immense power written by a master of 
weird fiction a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an 
old house in new england 


howard phillips lovecraft died last march at the height of 
his career though only forty six years of age he had built up 
an international reputation by the artistry and impeccable 
literary craftsmanship of his weird tales and he was regarded on both 
sides of the atlantic as probably the greatest contemporary master 
of weird fiction his ability to create and sustain a mood of 
brooding dread and unnamable horror is nowhere better shown than in 
the posthumous tale presented here the shunned house 


from even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent sometimes 
it enters directly into the composition of the events while sometimes 
it relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places 
the latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city 
of providence where in the late forties edgar allan poe used to 
sojourn often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess mrs 
whitman poe generally stopped at the mansion house in 
benefit street the renamed golden ball inn whose roof has sheltered washington 
jefferson and lafayette and his favorite walk led northward along 
the same street to mrs whitman s home and the neighboring 
hillside churchyard of st john s whose hidden expanse of eighteenth 
century gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination 

now the irony is this in this walk so many times repeated the world 
s greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass 
a particular house on the eastern side of the street a dingy 
antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill with a great 
unkempt yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country it 
does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it nor is there any 
evidence that he even noticed it and yet that house to the two persons 
in possession of certain information equals or outranks in horror 
the wildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly 
and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous 

the house was and for that matter still is of a kind to attract 
the attention of the curious originally a farm or semi farm building 
it followed the average new england colonial lines of the middle 
eighteenth century the prosperous peaked roof sort with two stories 
and dormerless attic and with the georgian doorway and interior 
panelling dictated by the progress of taste at that time it faced south with 
one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill 
and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street 
its construction over a century and a half ago had followed the 
grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity for 
benefit street at first called back street was laid out as a lane 
winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers and straightened only 
when the removal of the bodies to the north burial ground made it 
decently possible to cut through the old family plots 

at the start the western wall had lain some twenty feet up 
a precipitous lawn from the roadway but a widening of the street at 
about the time of the revolution sheared off most of the intervening space 
exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made 
giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window 
above ground close to the new line of public travel when the sidewalk 
was laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed 
and poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull 
gray brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet 
by the antique shingled bulk of the house proper 

illustration that awful door in benefit street which i had 
left ajar 

the farm like ground extended back very deeply up the hill almost 
to wheaton street the space south of the house abutting on 
benefit street was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level 
forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp mossy stone pierced by 
a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon 
like surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn rheumy brick walks 
and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns rusted kettles 
fallen from tripods of knotty sticks and similar paraphernalia set off 
the weather beaten front door with its broken fanlight rotting 
ionic pilasters and wormy triangular pediment 



what i heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that 
people died there in alarmingly great numbers that i was told was why 
the original owners had moved out some twenty years after building 
the place it was plainly unhealthy perhaps because of the dampness 
and fungous growths in the cellar the general sickish smell the drafts 
of the hallways or the quality of the well and pump water these 
things were bad enough and these were all that gained belief among the 
persons whom i knew only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle doctor 
elihu whipple revealed to me at length the darker vaguer surmises 
which formed an undercurrent of folklore among old time servants and 
humble folk surmises which never travelled far and which were 
largely forgotten when providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting 
modern population 

the general fact is that the house was never regarded by the solid 
part of the community as in any real sense haunted there were 
no widespread tales of rattling chains cold currents of air 
extinguished lights or faces at the window extremists sometimes said the house 
was unlucky but that is as far as even they went what was really 
beyond dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there or 
more accurately had died there since after some peculiar happenings 
over sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the 
sheer impossibility of renting it these persons were not all cut off 
suddenly by any one cause rather did it seem that their vitality was 
insidiously sapped so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency 
to weakness he may have naturally had and those who did not die 
displayed in varying degree a type of anemia or consumption and sometimes 
a decline of the mental faculties which spoke ill for the 
salubriousness of the building neighboring houses it must be added seemed 
entirely free from the noxious quality 

this much i knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show 
me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation 
in my childhood the shunned house was vacant with barren gnarled 
and terrible old trees long queerly pale grass and nightmarishly 
misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered we boys 
used to overrun the place and i can still recall my youthful terror not 
only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation but at 
the eldritch atmosphere and odor of the dilapidated house whose 
unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders the small 
paned windows were largely broken and a nameless air of desolation hung 
round the precarious panelling shaky interior shutters peeling wall paper 
falling plaster rickety staircases and such fragments of 
battered furniture as still remained the dust and cobwebs added their touch 
of the fearful and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily 
ascend the ladder to the attic a vast raftered length lighted only by 
small blinking windows in the gable ends and filled with a massed 
wreckage of chests chairs and spinning wheels which infinite years of 
deposit had shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes 

but after all the attic was not the most terrible part of the house 
it was the dank humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest 
repulsion on us even though it was wholly above ground on the street side 
with only a thin door and window pierced brick wall to separate it from 
the busy sidewalk we scarcely knew whether to haunt it in 
spectral fascination or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity 
for one thing the bad odor of the house was strongest there and 
for another thing we did not like the white fungous growths 
which occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard 
earth floor those fungi grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside 
were truly horrible in their outlines detestable parodies of 
toadstools and indian pipes whose like we had never seen in any other situation 
they rotted quickly and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent 
so that nocturnal passers by sometimes spoke of witch fires glowing 
behind the broken panes of the fetor spreading windows 

we never even in our wildest halloween moods visited this 
cellar by night but in some of our daytime visits could detect 
the phosphorescence especially when the day was dark and wet there 
was also a subtler thing we often thought we detected a very strange 
thing which was however merely suggestive at most i refer to a sort 
of cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor a vague shifting deposit 
of mold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst 
the sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen 
once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny 
resemblance to a doubled up human figure though generally no such kinship existed 
and often there was no whitish deposit whatever 

on a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed 
phenomenally strong and when in addition i had fancied i glimpsed a kind of thin 
yellowish shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern 
toward the yawning fireplace i spoke to my uncle about the matter he 
smiled at this odd conceit but it seemed that his smile was tinged 
with reminiscence later i heard that a similar notion entered into some 
of the wild ancient tales of the common folk a notion likewise alluding 
to ghoulish wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney 
and queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree roots that 
thrust their way into the cellar through the loose foundation stones 




not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and 
data which he had collected concerning the shunned house doctor whipple 
was a sane conservative physician of the old school and for all 
his interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts 
toward the abnormal his own view postulating simply a building and 
location of markedly unsanitary qualities had nothing to do with abnormality 
but he realized that the very picturesqueness which aroused his 
own interest would in a boy s fanciful mind take on all manner of 
gruesome imaginative associations 

the doctor was a bachelor a white haired clean shaven old 
fashioned gentleman and a local historian of note who had often broken a 
lance with such controversial guardians of tradition as sidney s rider 
and thomas w bicknell he lived with one man servant in a 
georgian homestead with knocker and iron railed steps balanced eerily on 
the steep ascent of north court street beside the ancient brick court 
and colony house where his grandfather a cousin of that 
celebrated privateersman captain whipple who burnt his majesty s armed 
schooner gaspee in had voted in the legislature on may for 
the independence of the rhode island colony around him in the damp 
low ceiled library with the musty white panelling heavy 
carved overmantel and small paned vine shaded windows were the relics 
and records of his ancient family among which were many dubious 
allusions to the shunned house in benefit street that pest spot lies not 
far distant for benefit runs ledgewise just above the court house along 
the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed 

when in the end my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked 
from my uncle the hoarded lore i sought there lay before me a strange 
enough chronicle long winded statistical and drearily genealogical as 
some of the matter was there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding 
tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me 
even more than it had impressed the good doctor separate events 
fitted together uncannily and seemingly irrelevant details held mines 
of hideous possibilities a new and burning curiosity grew in me 
compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate 

the first revelation led to an exhaustive research and finally to 
that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine for 
at the last my uncle insisted on joining the search i had commenced 
and after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me i 
am lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only 
with honor virtue good taste benevolence and learning i have reared 
a marble urn to his memory in st john s churchyard the place that 
poe loved the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill where tombs 
and headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and 
the houses and bank walls of benefit street 

the history of the house opening amidst a maze of dates revealed 
no trace of the sinister either about its construction or about 
the prosperous and honorable family who built it yet from the first a 
taint of calamity soon increased to boding significance was apparent 
my uncle s carefully compiled record began with the building of 
the structure in and followed the theme with an unusual amount 
of detail the shunned house it seems was first inhabited by 
william harris and his wife rhoby dexter with their children elkanah born 
in abigail born in william jr born in and ruth 
born in harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the west 
india trade connected with the firm of obadiah brown and his nephews 
after brown s death in the new firm of nicholas brown company made 
him master of the brig prudence providence built of tons 
thus enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since 
his marriage 

the site he had chosen a recently straightened part of the new 
and fashionable back street which ran along the side of the hill 
above crowded cheapside was all that could be wished and the building 
did justice to the location it was the best that moderate means 
could afford and harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth 
child which the family expected that child a boy came in december but 
was still born nor was any child to be born alive in that house for 
a century and a half 

the next april sickness occurred among the children and abigail 
and ruth died before the month was over doctor job ives diagnosed 
the trouble as some infantile fever though others declared it was more of 
a mere wasting away or decline it seemed in any event to be contagious 
for hannah bowen one of the two servants died of it in the 
following june eli lideason the other servant constantly complained 
of weakness and would have returned to his father s farm in rehoboth 
but for a sudden attachment for mehitabel pierce who was hired to 
succeed hannah he died the next year a sad year indeed since it marked 
the death of william harris himself enfeebled as he was by the climate 
of martinique where his occupation had kept him for considerable 
periods during the preceding decade 

the widowed rhoby harris never recovered from the shock of her husband 
s death and the passing of her first born elkanah two years later was 
the final blow to her reason in she fell victim to a mild form 
of insanity and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house 
her elder maiden sister mercy dexter having moved in to take charge 
of the family mercy was a plain raw boned woman of great strength 
but her health visibly declined from the time of her advent she was 
greatly devoted to her unfortunate sister and had an especial affection for 
her only surviving nephew william who from a sturdy infant had become 
a sickly spindling lad in this year the servant mehitabel died and 
the other servant preserved smith left without coherent explanation or 
at least with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked 
the smell of the place for a time mercy could secure no more help 
since the seven deaths and case of madness all occurring within five years 
space had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumor which 
later became so bizarre ultimately however she obtained new servants 
from out of town ann white a morose woman from that part of north 
kingstown now set off as the township of exeter and a capable boston man 
named zenas low 



it was ann white who first gave definite shape to the sinister 
idle talk mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from 
the nooseneck hill country for that remote bit of backwoods was then 
as now a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions as lately as 
an exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt 
its heart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to 
the public health and peace and one may imagine the point of view of 
the same section in ann s tongue was perniciously active and within 
a few months mercy discharged her filling her place with a faithful 
and amiable amazon from newport maria robbins 

meanwhile poor rhoby harris in her madness gave voice to dreams 
and imaginings of the most hideous sort at times her screams 
became insupportable and for long periods she would utter shrieking 
horrors which necessitated her son s temporary residence with his cousin 
peleg harris in presbyterian lane near the new college building the 
boy would seem to improve after these visits and had mercy been as wise 
as she was well meaning she would have let him live permanently 
with peleg just what mrs harris cried out in her fits of violence 
tradition hesitates to say or rather presents such 
extravagant accounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity 
certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments 
of french often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of 
that language or that the same person alone and guarded complained 
wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her in the 
servant zenas died and when mrs harris heard of it she laughed with a 
shocking delight utterly foreign to her the next year she herself died and 
was laid to rest in the north burial ground beside her husband 

upon the outbreak of trouble with great britain in william harris 
despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution managed 
to enlist in the army of observation under general greene and from 
that time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige in as 
a captain in the rhode island forces in new jersey under colonel angell 
he met and married phebe hetfield of elizabethtown whom he brought 
to providence upon his honorable discharge in the following year 

the young soldier s return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness 
the house it is true was still in good condition and the street had 
been widened and changed in name from back street to benefit street 
but mercy dexter s once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious decay 
so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice 
and disconcerting pallor qualities shared to a singular degree by the 
one remaining servant maria in the autumn of phebe harris gave 
birth to a still born daughter and on the fifteenth of the next may 
mercy dexter took leave of a useful austere and virtuous life 

william harris at last thoroughly convinced of the 
radically unhealthful nature of his abode now took steps toward quitting it 
and closing it for ever securing temporary quarters for himself and 
his wife at the newly opened golden ball inn he arranged for the 
building of a new and finer house in westminster street in the growing part 
of the town across the great bridge there in his son dutee 
was born and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of 
commerce drove them back across the river and over the hill to angell street 
in the newer east side residence district where the late archer 
harris built his sumptuous but hideous french roofed mansion in 
william and phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of but 
dutee was brought up by his cousin rathbone harris peleg s son 

rathbone was a practical man and rented the benefit street 
house despite william s wish to keep it vacant he considered it an 
obligation to his ward to make the most of all the boy s property nor did 
he concern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so 
many changes of tenants or the steadily growing aversion with which 
the house was generally regarded it is likely that he felt only 
vexation when in the town council ordered him to fumigate the place 
with sulfur tar and gum camphor on account of the much discussed deaths 
of four persons presumably caused by the then diminishing fever epidemic 
they said the place had a febrile smell 

dutee himself thought little of the house for he grew up to be 
a privateersman and served with distinction on the vigilant 
under captain cahoone in the war of he returned unharmed married 
in and became a father on that memorable night of september 
when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town 
and floated a tall sloop well up westminster street so that its masts 
almost tapped the harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new boy 
welcome was a seaman s son 

welcome did not survive his father but lived to perish gloriously 
at fredericksburg in neither he nor his son archer knew of 
the shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible 
to rent perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odor of unkempt 
old age indeed it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating 
in which the excitement of the war tended to throw into obscurity 
carrington harris last of the male line knew it only as a deserted 
and somewhat picturesque center of legend until i told him my experience 
he had meant to tear it down and build an apartment house on the site 
but after my account decided to let it stand install plumbing and rent it 
nor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants the horror 
has gone 




it may well be imagined how powerfully i was affected by the annals 
of the harrises in this continuous record there seemed to me to brood 
a persistent evil beyond anything in nature as i had known it an 
evil clearly connected with the house and not with the family 
this impression was confirmed by my uncle s less systematic array 
of miscellaneous data legends transcribed from servant gossip 
cuttings from the papers copies of death certificates by fellow physicians 
and the like all of this material i cannot hope to give for my uncle was 
a tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house 
but i may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by 
their recurrence through many reports from diverse sources for example 
the servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the 
fungous and malodorous cellar of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence 
there had been servants ann white especially who would not use 
the cellar kitchen and at least three well defined legends bore upon 
the queer quasi human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree roots and 
patches of mold in that region these latter narratives interested 
me profoundly on account of what i had seen in my boyhood but i felt 
that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured 
by additions from the common stock of local ghost lore 

ann white with her exeter superstition had promulgated the 
most extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale alleging 
that there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires the 
dead who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of 
the living whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or 
spirits abroad by night to destroy a vampire one must the grandmothers say 
exhume it and burn its heart or at least drive a stake through 
that organ and ann s dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had 
been prominent in bringing about her discharge 

her tales however commanded a wide audience and were the more 
readily accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for 
burial purposes to me their interest depended less on this circumstance 
than on the peculiarly appropriate way in which they dovetailed with 
certain other things the complaint of the departing servant preserved smith 
who had preceded ann and never heard of her that something sucked 
his breath at night the death certificates of the fever victims of 
issued by doctor chad hopkins and showing the four deceased persons 
all unaccountably lacking in blood and the obscure passages of poor 
rhoby harris s ravings where she complained of the sharp teeth of 
a glassy eyed half visible presence 

free from unwarranted superstition though i am these things produced 
in me an odd sensation which was intensified by a pair of widely 
separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house one from 
the providence gazette and country journal of april and 
the other from the daily transcript and chronicle of october 
each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance 
whose duplication was remarkable it seems that in both instances the 
dying person in a gentle old lady named stafford and in 
a schoolteacher of middle age named eleazar durfee became transfigured 
in a horrible way glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat 
of the attending physician even more puzzling though was the final 
case which put an end to the renting of the house a series of anemia 
deaths preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would 
craftily attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrist 

this was in and when my uncle had just begun his 
medical practise and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from 
his elder professional colleagues the really inexplicable thing was the 
way in which the victims ignorant people for the ill smelling and 
widely shunned house could now be rented to no others would 
babble maledictions in french a language they could not possibly have 
studied to any extent it made one think of poor rhoby harris nearly a 
century before and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting 
historical data on the house after listening some time subsequent to his 
return from the war to the first hand account of doctors chase and whitmarsh 
indeed i could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject 
and that he was glad of my own interest an open minded and 
sympathetic interest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which 
others would merely have laughed his fancy had not gone so far as mine but 
he felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities 
and worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque 
and macabre 

for my part i was disposed to take the whole subject with 
profound seriousness and began at once not only to review the evidence but 
to accumulate as much more as i could i talked with the elderly 
archer harris then owner of the house many times before his death in 
and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister alice 
an authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected 
when however i asked them what connection with france or its 
language the house could have they confessed themselves as frankly baffled 
and ignorant as i archer knew nothing and all that miss harris could 
say was that an old allusion her grandfather dutee harris had heard 
of might have shed a little light the old seaman who had survived his 
son welcome s death in battle by two years had not himself known 
the legend but recalled that his earliest nurse the ancient maria robbins 
seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a 
weird significance to the french raving of rhoby harris which she had 
so often heard during the last days of that hapless woman maria had 
been at the shunned house from till the removal of the family in 
and had seen mercy dexter die once she hinted to the child dutee of 
a somewhat peculiar circumstance in mercy s last moments but he had 
soon forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar 
the granddaughter moreover recalled even this much with difficulty 
she and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was archer 
s son carrington the present owner with whom i talked after 
my experience 



having exhausted the harris family of all the information it 
could furnish i turned my attention to early town records and deeds with 
a zeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown 
in the same work what i wished was a comprehensive history of the 
site from its very settlement in or even before if any 
narragansett indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data i found at 
the start that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot 
granted originally to john throckmorton one of many similar strips beginning 
at the town street beside the river and extending up over the hill to 
a line roughly corresponding with the modern hope street the 
throckmorton lot had later of course been much subdivided and i became 
very assiduous in tracing that section through which back or benefit 
street was later run it had as rumor indeed said been the 
throckmorton graveyard but as i examined the records more carefully i found 
that the graves had all been transferred at an early date to the north 
burial ground on the pawtucket west road 

then suddenly i came by a rare piece of chance since it was not in 
the main body of records and might easily have been missed upon 
something which aroused my keenest eagerness fitting in as it did with several 
of the queerest phases of the affair it was the record of a lease 
in of a small tract of ground to an etienne roulet and wife at 
last the french element had appeared that and another deeper element 
of horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my 
weird and heterogeneous reading and i feverishly studied the platting of 
the locality as it had been before the cutting through and 
partial straightening of back street between and i found what i 
had half expected that where the shunned house now stood the roulets 
had laid out their graveyard behind a one story and attic cottage and 
that no record of any transfer of graves existed the document indeed 
ended in much confusion and i was forced to ransack both the rhode 
island historical society and shepley library before i could find a local 
door which the name of etienne roulet would unlock in the end i did 
find something something of such vague but monstrous import that i set 
about at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new 
and excited minuteness 

the roulets it seemed had come in from east greenwich down 
the west shore of narragansett bay they were huguenots from caude and 
had encountered much opposition before the providence selectmen allowed 
them to settle in the town unpopularity had dogged them in east greenwich 
whither they had come in after the revocation of the edict 
of nantes and rumor said that the cause of dislike extended beyond 
mere racial and national prejudice or the land disputes which involved 
other french settlers with the english in rivalries which not even 
governor andros could quell but their ardent protestantism too ardent 
some whispered and their evident distress when virtually driven from 
the village down the bay had moved the sympathy of the town fathers 
here the strangers had been granted a haven and the swarthy etienne roulet 
less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing 
queer diagrams was given a clerical post in the warehouse at 
pardon tillinghast s wharf far south in town street there had however 
been a riot of some sort later on perhaps forty years later after 
old roulet s death and no one seemed to hear of the family after that 

for a century and more it appeared the roulets had been 
well remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the 
quiet life of a new england seaport etienne s son paul a surly fellow 
whose erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out 
the family was particularly a source of speculation and though 
providence never shared the witchcraft panics of her puritan neighbors it 
was freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered 
at the proper time nor directed toward the proper object all this 
had undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old maria robbins 
what relation it had to the french ravings of rhoby harris and 
other inhabitants of the shunned house imagination or future discovery 
alone could determine i wondered how many of those who had known the 
legends realized that additional link with the terrible which my wider 
reading had given me that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror 
which tells of the creature jacques roulet of caude who in 
was condemned to death as a demoniac but afterward saved from the stake 
by the paris parliament and shut in a madhouse he had been found 
covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood shortly after the killing 
and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves one wolf was seen to lope 
away unhurt surely a pretty hearthside tale with a queer significance as 
to name and place but i decided that the providence gossips could not 
have generally known of it had they known the coincidence of names 
would have brought some drastic and frightened action indeed might not 
its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased 
the roulets from the town 



i now visited the accursed place with increased frequency studying 
the unwholesome vegetation of the garden examining all the walls of 
the building and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor 
finally with carrington harris s permission i fitted a key to 
the disused door opening from the cellar directly upon benefit street 
preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than 
the dark stairs ground floor hall and front door could give there 
where morbidity lurked most thickly i searched and poked during 
long afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the 
cobwebbed above ground windows and a sense of security glowed from the 
unlocked door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside 
nothing new rewarded my efforts only the same depressing mustiness 
and faint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on 
the floor and i fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me 
curiously through the broken panes 

at length upon a suggestion of my uncle s i decided to try the 
spot nocturnally and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric 
torch over the moldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted 
half phosphorescent fungi the place had dispirited me curiously 
that evening and i was almost prepared when i saw or thought i saw 
amidst the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the 
huddled form i had suspected from boyhood its clearness was astonishing 
and unprecedented and as i watched i seemed to see again the thin 
yellowish shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that 
rainy afternoon so many years before 

above the anthropomorphic patch of mold by the fireplace it rose 
a subtle sickish almost luminous vapor which as it hung trembling in 
the dampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form 
gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into 
the blackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake it was 
truly horrible and the more so to me because of what i knew of the spot 
refusing to flee i watched it fade and as i watched i felt that it 
was in turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than visible 
when i told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused and after a 
tense hour of reflection arrived at a definite and drastic decision 
weighing in his mind the importance of the matter and the significance of 
our relation to it he insisted that we both test and if 
possible destroy the horror of the house by a joint night or nights 
of aggressive vigil in that musty and fungus cursed cellar 




on wednesday june after a proper notification of 
carrington harris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find 
my uncle and i conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a 
folding camp cot together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight 
and intricacy these we placed in the cellar during the day screening 
the windows with paper and planning to return in the evening for our 
first vigil we had locked the door from the cellar to the ground floor 
and having a key to the outside cellar door were prepared to leave 
our expensive and delicate apparatus which we had obtained secretly and 
at great cost as many days as our vigils might be protracted it was 
our design to sit up together till very late and then watch singly 
till dawn in two hour stretches myself first and then my companion 
the inactive member resting on the cot 

the natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments 
from the laboratories of brown university and the cranston street armory 
and instinctively assumed direction of our venture was a 
marvelous commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man 
of eighty one elihu whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws 
he had preached as a physician and but for what happened later would 
be here in full vigor today only two persons suspected what 
did happen carrington harris and myself i had to tell harris because 
he owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it then too 
we had spoken to him in advance of our quest and i felt after 
my uncle s going that he would understand and assist me in some 
vitally necessary public explanations he turned very pale but agreed to 
help me and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house 

to declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of 
watching would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous we were not as 
i have said in any sense childishly superstitious but scientific 
study and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three 
dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance 
and energy in this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence 
from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of 
certain forces of great power and so far as the human point of view 
is concerned exceptional malignancy to say that we actually believed 
in vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement 
rather must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility 
of certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force 
and attenuated matter existing very infrequently in three dimensional 
space because of its more intimate connection with other spatial units 
yet close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us 
occasional manifestations which we for lack of a proper vantage point may 
never hope to understand 

in short it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible 
array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house 
traceable to one or another of the ill favored french settlers of 
two centuries before and still operative through rare and unknown laws 
of atomic and electronic motion that the family of roulet had possessed 
an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity dark spheres which 
for normal folk hold only repulsion and terror their recorded 
history seemed to prove had not then the riots of those 
bygone seventeen thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the 
morbid brain of one or more of them notably the sinister paul roulet 
which obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob 
and continued to function in some multiple dimensioned space along 
the original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of 
the encroaching community 

such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility 
in the light of a newer science which includes the theories of 
relativity and intra atomic action one might easily imagine an alien nucleus 
of substance or energy formless or otherwise kept alive by 
imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the life force or bodily tissue 
and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it 
penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself it might 
be actively hostile or it might be dictated merely by blind motives 
of self preservation in any case such a monster must of necessity be 
in our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder whose extirpation 
forms a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world s life health 
and sanity 

what baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we 
might encounter the thing no sane person had ever seen it and few had 
ever felt it definitely it might be pure energy a form ethereal and 
outside the realm of substance or it might be partly material some unknown 
and equivocal mass of plasticity capable of changing at will to 
nebulous approximations of the solid liquid gaseous or tenuously 
unparticled states the anthropomorphic patch of mold on the floor the form of 
the yellowish vapor and the curvature of the tree roots in some of the 
old tales all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connection with 
the human shape but how representative or permanent that similarity 
might be none could say with any kind of certainty 



we had devised two weapons to fight it a large and specially 
fitted crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided 
with peculiar screens and reflectors in case it proved intangible 
and opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations and a pair 
of military flame throwers of the sort used in the world war in case 
it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction 
for like the superstitious exeter rustics we were prepared to burn 
the thing s heart out if heart existed to burn all this 
aggressive mechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully arranged 
with reference to the cot and chairs and to the spot before the 
fireplace where the mold had taken strange shapes that suggestive patch by 
the way was only faintly visible when we placed our furniture 
and instruments and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil 
for a moment i half doubted that i had ever seen it in the more 
definitely limned form but then i thought of the legends 

our cellar vigil began at ten p m daylight saving time and as 
it continued we found no promise of pertinent developments a weak 
filtered glow from the rain harassed street lamps outside and a 
feeble phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within showed the 
dripping stone of the walls from which all traces of whitewash had vanished 
the dank fetid and mildew tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi 
the rotting remains of what had been stools chairs and tables 
and other more shapeless furniture the heavy planks and massive beams 
of the ground floor overhead the decrepit plank door leading to bins 
and chambers beneath other parts of the house the crumbling stone 
staircase with ruined wooden hand rail and the crude and cavernous fireplace 
of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past 
presence of hooks andirons spit crane and a door to the dutch oven 
these things and our austere cot and camp chairs and the heavy and 
intricate destructive machinery we had brought 

we had as in my own former explorations left the door to the 
street unlocked so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie 
open in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with it was our 
idea that our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever 
malign entity lurked there and that being prepared we could dispose of 
the thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we 
had recognized and observed it sufficiently how long it might require 
to evoke and extinguish the thing we had no notion it occurred to us 
too that our venture was far from safe for in what strength the 
thing might appear no one could tell but we deemed the game worth the hazard 
and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly conscious that the 
seeking of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat 
our entire purpose such was our frame of mind as we talked far into 
the night till my uncle s growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie 
down for his two hour sleep 

something like fear chilled me as i sat there in the small 
hours alone i say alone for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone 
perhaps more alone than he can realize my uncle breathed heavily 
his deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside 
and punctuated by another nerve racking sound of distant dripping 
water within for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather and 
in this storm positively swamp like i studied the loose antique 
masonry of the walls in the fungus light and the feeble rays which stole in 
from the street through the screened window and once when the 
noisome atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me i opened the door 
and looked up and down the street feasting my eyes on familiar sights 
and my nostrils on wholesome air still nothing occurred to reward 
my watching and i yawned repeatedly fatigue getting the better 
of apprehension 

then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice he 
had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of 
the first hour but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity 
occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the 
qualities of a choking moan 

i turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted 
so rising and crossing to the other side of the cot i again flashed 
the light to see if he seemed in any pain what i saw unnerved me 
most surprisingly considering its relative triviality it must have 
been merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister 
nature of our location and mission for surely the circumstance was not 
in itself frightful or unnatural it was merely that my uncle s 
facial expression disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which 
our situation prompted betrayed considerable agitation and seemed not 
at all characteristic of him his habitual expression was one of kindly 
and well bred calm whereas now a variety of emotions seemed 
struggling within him i think on the whole that it was this variety 
which chiefly disturbed me my uncle as he gasped and tossed in 
increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open seemed not one 
but many men and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself 



all at once he commenced to mutter and i did not like the look of 
his mouth and teeth as he spoke the words were at first indistinguishable 
and then with a tremendous start i recognized something about 
them which filled me with icy fear till i recalled the breadth of my uncle 
s education and the interminable translations he had made 
from anthropological and antiquarian articles in the revue des deux mondes 
for the venerable elihu whipple was muttering in french and the 
few phrases i could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths 
he had ever adapted from the famous paris magazine 

suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper s forehead and 
he leaped abruptly up half awake the jumble of french changed to a cry 
in english and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly my breath my breath 
then the awakening became complete and with a subsidence of 
facial expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began 
to relate a dream whose nucleus of significance i could only surmise with 
a kind of awe 

he had he said floated off from a very ordinary series 
of dream pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing 
he had ever read it was of this world and yet not of it a 
shadowy geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar 
things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations there was a 
suggestion of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon another 
an arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space 
seemed dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion in this 
kaleidoscopic vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snap shots if one might 
use the term of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity 

once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit with a 
crowd of angry faces framed by straggling locks and three cornered 
hats frowning down on him again he seemed to be in the interior of 
a house an old house apparently but the details and inhabitants 
were constantly changing and he could never be certain of the faces or 
the furniture or even of the room itself since doors and windows seemed 
in just as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects 
it was queer damnably queer and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly as 
if half expecting not to be believed when he declared that of the 
strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the harris family 
and all the while there was a personal sensation of choking as if 
some pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought 
to possess itself of his vital processes 

i shuddered at the thought of those vital processes worn as they 
were by eighty one years of continuous functioning in conflict with 
unknown forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid 
but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams and 
that these uncomfortable visions could be at most no more than my uncle 
s reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately 
filled our minds to the exclusion of all else 

conversation also soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness 
and in time i yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber my 
uncle seemed now very wakeful and welcomed his period of watching even 
though the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours 

sleep seized me quickly and i was at once haunted with dreams of 
the most disturbing kind i felt in my visions a cosmic and 
abysmal loneness with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where 
i lay confined i seemed bound and gagged and taunted by the 
echoing yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood my uncle s 
face came to me with less pleasant association than in waking hours and 
i recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream it was not 
a pleasant sleep and for a second i was not sorry for the echoing 
shriek which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp 
and startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood 
out with more than natural clearness and reality 




i had been lying with my face away from my uncle s chair so that 
in this sudden flash of awakening i saw only the door to the street 
the window and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room 
all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light 
brighter than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside it 
was not a strong or even a fairly strong light certainly not nearly 
strong enough to read an average book by but it cast a shadow of myself 
and the cot on the floor and had a yellowish penetrating force that 
hinted at things more potent than luminosity this i perceived with 
unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were 
violently assailed for on my ears rang the reverberations of that 
shocking scream while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place 
my mind as alert as my senses recognized the gravely unusual 
and almost automatically i leaped up and turned about to grasp 
the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the moldy 
spot before the fireplace as i turned i dreaded what i was to see for 
the scream had been in my uncle s voice and i knew not against what 
menace i should have to defend him and myself 

yet after all the sight was worse than i had dreaded there are 
horrors beyond horrors and this was one of those nuclei of all 
dreamable hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few 
out of the fungus ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse light 
yellow and diseased which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height 
in vague outlines half human and half monstrous through which i could 
see the chimney and fireplace beyond it was all eyes wolfish 
and mocking and the rugose insect like head dissolved at the top to a 
thin stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up 
the chimney i say that i saw this thing but it is only in 
conscious retrospection that i ever definitely traced its damnable approach 
to form at the time it was to me only a seething dimly 
phosphorescent cloud of fungous loathsomeness enveloping and dissolving to 
an abhorrent plasticity the one object on which all my attention 
was focussed that object was my uncle the venerable elihu whipple 
who with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me 
and reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror 
had brought 

it was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad i had 
drilled myself in preparation for the crucial moment and blind training 
saved me recognizing the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter 
or material chemistry and therefore ignoring the flame thrower 
which loomed on my left i threw on the current of the crookes tube apparatus 
and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the 
strongest ether radiations which man s art can arouse from the spaces and 
fluids of nature there was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering and 
the yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes but i saw the 
dimness was only that of contrast and that the waves from the machine had 
no effect whatever 

then in the midst of that demoniac spectacle i saw a fresh 
horror which brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and 
staggering toward that unlocked door to the quiet street careless of what 
abnormal terrors i loosed upon the world or what thoughts or judgments of men 
i brought down upon my head in that dim blend of blue and yellow the 
form of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence 
eludes all description and in which there played across his vanishing 
face such changes of identity as only madness can conceive he was at once 
a devil and a multitude a charnel house and a pageant lit by the 
mixed and uncertain beams that gelatinous face assumed a dozen a score 
a hundred aspects grinning as it sank to the ground on a body 
that melted like tallow in the caricatured likeness of legions strange 
and yet not strange 

i saw the features of the harris line masculine and feminine adult 
and infantile and other features old and young coarse and refined 
familiar and unfamiliar for a second there flashed a 
degraded counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad rhoby harris that i had seen 
in the school of design museum and another time i thought i caught 
the raw boned image of mercy dexter as i recalled her from a painting 
in carrington harris s house it was frightful beyond conception 
toward the last when a curious blend of servant and baby visages 
flickered close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease 
was spreading it seemed as though the shifting features fought 
against themselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncle s 
kindly face i like to think that he existed at that moment and that he 
tried to bid me farewell it seems to me i hiccupped a farewell from my 
own parched throat as i lurched out into the street a thin stream of 
grease following me through the door to the rain drenched sidewalk 



the rest is shadowy and monstrous there was no one in the 
soaking street and in all the world there was no one i dared tell i 
walked aimlessly south past college hill and the athen um down hopkins street 
and over the bridge to the business section where tall buildings 
seemed to guard me as modern material things guard the world from ancient 
and unwholesome wonder then gray dawn unfolded wetly from the east 
silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples and 
beckoning me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished and in 
the end i went wet hatless and dazed in the morning light and 
entered that awful door in benefit street which i had left ajar and which 
still swung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom 
i dared not speak 

the grease was gone for the moldy floor was porous and in front of 
the fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled up form traced in niter 
i looked at the cot the chairs the instruments my neglected hat 
and the yellowed straw hat of my uncle dazedness was uppermost and i 
could scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality then 
thought trickled back and i knew that i had witnessed things more horrible 
than i had dreamed 

sitting down i tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let 
me just what had happened and how i might end the horror if indeed it 
had been real matter it seemed not to be nor ether nor anything 
else conceivable by mortal mind what then but some exotic emanation 
some vampirish vapor such as exeter rustics tell of as lurking 
over certain churchyards this i felt was the clue and again i looked at 
the floor before the fireplace where the mold and niter had taken 
strange forms 

in ten minutes my mind was made up and taking my hat i set out 
for home where i bathed ate and gave by telephone an order for a pickax 
a spade a military gas mask and six carboys of sulfuric acid all 
to be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house 
in benefit street after that i tried to sleep and failing passed 
the hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract 
my mood 

at eleven a m the next day i commenced digging it was sunny weather 
and i was glad of that i was still alone for as much as i feared 
the unknown horror i sought there was more fear in the thought of 
telling anybody later i told harris only through sheer necessity and 
because he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so 
little toward belief as i turned up the stinking black earth in front of 
the fireplace my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from 
the white fungi which it severed i trembled at the dubious thoughts of 
what i might uncover some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind 
and this seemed to me one of them 

my hand shook perceptibly but still i delved after a while standing 
in the large hole i had made with the deepening of the hole which 
was about six feet square the evil smell increased and i lost all doubt 
of my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had 
cursed the house for over a century and a half i wondered what it would 
look like what its form and substance would be and how big it might 
have waxed through long ages of life sucking at length i climbed out of 
the hole and dispersed the heaped up dirt then arranging the great 
carboys of acid around and near two sides so that when necessary i might 
empty them all down the aperture in quick succession after that i 
dumped earth only along the other two sides working more slowly and donning 
my gas mask as the smell grew i was nearly unnerved at my proximity to 
a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit 

suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth i shuddered 
and made a motion as if to climb out of the hole which was now as deep 
as my neck then courage returned and i scraped away more dirt in 
the light of the electric torch i had provided the surface i uncovered 
was fishy and glassy a kind of semi putrid congealed jelly with 
suggestions of translucency i scraped further and saw that it had form there 
was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over the exposed 
area was huge and roughly cylindrical like a mammoth soft blue 
white stovepipe doubled in two its largest part some two feet in diameter 
still more i scraped and then abruptly i leaped out of the hole 
and away from the filthy thing frantically unstopping and tilting the 
heavy carboys and precipitating their corrosive contents one after 
another down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose 
titan elbow i had seen 



the blinding maelstrom of greenish yellow vapor which 
surged tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended 
will never leave my memory all along the hill people tell of the yellow day 
when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped 
in the providence river but i know how mistaken they are as to the source 
they tell too of the hideous roar which at the same time came 
from some disordered water pipe or gas main underground but again i 
could correct them if i dared it was unspeakably shocking and i do not 
see how i lived through it i did faint after emptying the fourth carboy 
which i had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask 
but when i recovered i saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapors 

the two remaining carboys i emptied down without particular result 
and after a time i felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit 
it was twilight before i was done but fear had gone out of the place 
the dampness was less fetid and all the strange fungi had withered to 
a kind of harmless grayish powder which blew ash like along the floor 
one of earth s nethermost terrors had perished for ever and if there be 
a hell it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed thing 
and as i patted down the last spadeful of mold i shed the first of the 
many tears with which i have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle 
s memory 

the next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in 
the shunned house s terraced garden and shortly afterward carrington 
harris rented the place it is still spectral but its strangeness 
fascinates me and i shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is 
torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building 
the barren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small sweet apples 
and last year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs
